Django-components is still in active development.

Since django-components is in pre-1.0 development, the public API is not yet frozen.
This means that there may be breaking changes between minor versions.
We try to minimize the number of breaking changes, but sometimes it's unavoidable.

When upgrading, please read the [Release notes](../releases/index.md).

If you're on older pre-v1.0 versions of django-components, we recommend doing step-wise
upgrades in the following order:

- [v0.26](../releases/v0.26.md)
- [v0.50](../releases/v0.50.md)
- [v0.70](../releases/v0.70.md)
- [v0.77](../releases/v0.77.md)
- [v0.81](../releases/v0.81.md)
- [v0.85](../releases/v0.85.md)
- [v0.92](../releases/v0.92.md)
- [v0.100](../releases/v0.100.md)
- [v0.110](../releases/v0.110.md)
- [v0.140.0](../releases/v0.140.0.md)

These versions introduced breaking changes that are not backwards compatible.
