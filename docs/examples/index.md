# Overview

`django-components` makes it easy to share components between projects
([See how to package components](../concepts/advanced/component_libraries.md)).

Here you will find public examples of components and component libraries.

If you have components that would be useful to others, open a [pull request](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pulls) to add them to this collection.

## Scenarios

- [HTML fragments](./fragments) - Load HTML fragments using different client-side techniques: vanilla JavaScript, AlpineJS, and HTMX.
- [Error handling](./error_fallback) - A component that catches errors and displays fallback content, similar to React's ErrorBoundary.
- [Recursion](./recursion) - 100 nested components? Not a problem! Handle recursive rendering out of the box.
- [A/B Testing](./ab_testing) - Dynamically render different component versions. Use for A/B testing, phased rollouts, etc.

## Components

- [FormGrid](./form_grid) - A form component that automatically generates labels and arranges fields in a grid.
- [Tabs (AlpineJS)](./tabs) - Dynamic tabs with [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/).
